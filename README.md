# PreGIP: Watermarking the Pretraining of Graph Neural Networks for Deep Intellectual Property Protection
An official PyTorch implementation of "PreGIP: Watermarking the Pretraining of Graph Neural Networks for Deep Intellectual Property Protection" (WWW 2023). [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04435) If you find this repo to be useful, please cite our paper. Thank you.

## Note
We will clean our code as soon as possible, thank you!

## Run the code
To run our code in the semi-supervised setting, you can try to run
```
bash ./train_IPGCL.sh/
```

To run our code in transfer learning setting, you can refer to the `transfer` branch.
